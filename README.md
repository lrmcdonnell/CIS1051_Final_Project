# Protein Visualization
```
This app allows you to input an amino acid sequence to determine the protein structure.

## CIS 1051 Final Project

Hi, this is my final project. I hope you enjoy!

##Notes
- This project was challenging, but I am proud of how it came out. It was different than my original vision, but I like it.
- Streamlit was a very nice interface to create the web app, and I will probably use it again.
- I couldn't figure out certain features that I wanted to include. Such as: toggle bar for changing the spin speed of the structure, a button to stop the spinning entirely, changing the colors, and selecting different sections of the protein. I think with more time I could have eventually figured it out, but maybe not honestly. I was getting so frustrated with some of these.
- I'm glad I got the thing to work at all, although I did have help and inspiration from my resources below. PDB was the database I used to fetch the sequencing data. ESMFold is a similar sort of idea to this project, which you can read more through the links on the app. ChatGPT helped guide me on the project idea itself, and with resources and next steps to take when I was stuck. You can check out a similar app to mine under bullet 4 of the 'Resources' section below, which was a final product inspiration. Finally, getting the streamlit web app coordinated was greatly facilitated by a pre-made template (see 5th bullet below and/or link at the top of the repository title).
- Overall, CIS 1051 was a great class and learning experience. I want to thank Professor Rosen and the TA's (shoutout Nabid) for being awesome this semester!
